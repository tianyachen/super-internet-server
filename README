Developing high performance Web servers

Various servers are developed on top of Tiny server introcuded in CS:APP Book.

This is the home directory for the baseline and optimized servers, they use the GET method
to serve static content (text, HTML, GIF, and JPG files) out of ./ and to serve dynamic
content by running CGI programs out of ./cgi-bin. The default 
page is home.html (rather than index.html) so that we can view
the contents of the directory from a browser.

The code compiles and runs cleanly using gcc on a Linux kernel.

To run the servers:
   Run "./super_server <port>" and "./baseline <port>" on the server machine, 
	e.g., "./super_server 8000".
   Point your browser at super_server: 
	static content: http://<host>:8000
	dynamic content: http://<host>:8000/cgi-bin/adder?1&2
