    <h1>Benchmark results for different server design</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Super_server</b>: this server uses dynamic linking (i.e. cgi program are part of mylib.so shared library) 
        </br>
            protocol to implement cgi and serve dynamic contents. 
            On top of that, this server also ultilize pre-threading design for faster performance. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Fast_server</b>: this server uses dynamic linking for cgi and traditional multi-thread server design. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Baseline server</b>: this server uses traditional cgi protocol and multi-threading server design. 
            </br>Specifically,it create a peer thread for each client request and fork a new proccess to execute cgi program if client requests dynamic content. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The following test is done by running ApacheBench and requesting dynamic content. 
        The benchmark performance are shown below. 
        The evaluation metrics are requests per seconds, failed requests, and transfer rate. 
        
        In conclusion, the super_server (pre-threading + dynamic linking) is the fastest, fast_server 
        (normal threading + dynamic linking) is the second, and baseline (threading + fork&execv) is the slowest.
        
        All servers performance increases as concurrency increases. However, as concurrency becomes larger and larger,
        we start to see some performance drops on servers but super_server keeps the best performance among the three.
